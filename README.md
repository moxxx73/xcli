# xcli

This library was made purely to saisfy my weird need to write all code myself. All of my code runs   
in the terminal so i thought why not make it look, somewhat, fancy.  

## Building xcli

just call the makefile:
```
make && sudo make install
``` 

running `make install` will create symbolics from the build directory to `/usr/local/[lib/include]`.  
ofcourse, its up to you where these libraries will be installed. `/usr/local/` is just where i put them  

## TODO

+ document code
+ finish code that tests functionality (not yet in the current commit) 
+ -and obviously add more functionality
+ lastly, make improvements.

(improvements will lakely be made in conjunction with test code)
